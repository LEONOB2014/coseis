Support Operator Rupture Dynamics (SORD)

Solver

SORD solves the isotropic viscoelastic wave equation, and includes dynamic
rupture and PML absorbing boundaries.  The mesh is logically rectangular.  The
method of Support Operators for constructin the spatial difference operators is
similar to finite elements.

MPI Communications

The topology is rectangular domain decomposition.  Sub-divisions may be in one,
two, or three dimensions.  Communications are synchronous and blocking between
neighboring processes in the topology.

I/O

MPII/O is used for all input and output aside from reading the inital parameter
file and checkpointing.
Time series output is buffered and written out periodically.  
MPII/O is used but may be optionally switched off.  In that case Volume input for
the mesh and material models, as well as volume snapshot output is
performed with MPII/O.  Optionally MPII/O may be switched off, and separate
files used per process.  Check-pointing always uses separate files for
efficiency.  Intervals for writing buffers, snapshots, and checkpoints are
configurable.  Parallel HDF5 was considered for output, but was rejected due to
the added level or library dependence on top of MPII/O.  Plain MPII/O is widely
used and stable.

Optimization



Fault detection

Periodically a single global reduction is preformed to compile global
statistics.  The statics are checked for overflows and invalid numbers, and the
run halted if found.  The statistics are also written to disk for monitoring
the run.

SUMMARY

The Support Operator Rupture Dynamics (SORD) code simulates spontaneous rupture
within a 3D isotropic viscoelastic solid.  Wave motions are computed on a
logically rectangular hexahedral mesh, using the generalized finite difference
method of support operators.  Stiffness and viscous hourglass corrections are
employed to suppress suppress zero-energy grid oscillation modes.  The fault
surface is modeled by coupled double nodes, where the strength of the coupling
is determined by a linear slip-weakening friction law.  External boundaries may
be reflective or absorbing, where absorbing boundaries are handled using the
method of perfectly matched layers (PML).  SORD is written in Fortran 95 and
parallelized for multi-processor execution using Message Passing Interface
(MPI).

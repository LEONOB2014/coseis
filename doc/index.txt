System requirements
===================

*   `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`_, and
    `NumPy <http://http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ (Numerical Python).

*   (Optional) Fortran 95 compiler. Required for SORD and CVM.

*   (Optional) Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  Required for
    SORD and CVM4 multi-core processing.

*   (Optional) `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_, `SciPy
    <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, and Pyproj Python packages.  Required for
    supplemental plotting, signal processing, and mesh generation utilities.

*   (Optional) `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ version control system.
    Useful for development and staying updated with the latest code version.


Installation
============

Fortran and MPI installation should only be necessary for personal computers.
HPC systems generally supply specifically tuned Fortran compilers and MPI
libraries.

1.  GNU Fortran is recommended if you don't already have a Fortran 95 compiler.

    Fedora/Red Hat Linux:
    ::

        sudo yum install gfortran

    Ubuntu Linux:
    ::

        sudo apt-get install gfortran

    Mac OS X:

        First install either the iPhone or the Mac-only version of `Xcode
        <http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html>`_ available from Apple
        Developer Connection (free `membership <http://connect.apple.com>`__ required).
        Then install the GNU Fortran version available from the `R for Mac OS X
        Developer's Page <http://r.research.att.com/tools>`_ (versions from MacPorts
        and Fink seem to be problematic and are not recommended).

2.  `MPICH2 <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/>`_ is recommended
    if you need MPI.  The following shell script installs MPICH2:

        `install-mpich.sh <../sbin/install-mpich.sh>`_

3.  It is recommended that you install a private copy of Python for Coseis.  The
    following script installs Python and NumPy:

        `install-python.sh <../sbin/install-python.sh>`_

    `Enthought Python Distribution
    <http://www.enthought.com/products/epddownload.php>`_ (EPD) is another
    option that includes many bells and whistles such as the `Mayavi
    <http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi>`_ visualization package.

4.  Download the source code.  The best option is to use the `Coseis GitHub
    repository <http://github.com/gely/coseis>`__ with Git_ version control, which
    facilitates applying code updates, and merging local modifications:

        git clone git://github.com/gely/coseis.git

    Update to the latest changes anytime with:
    ::

        git pull

    Alternatively, download and unpack the source tar archive:
    ::

        curl http://earth.usc.edu/~gely/coseis/download/coseis.tgz | tar zx

5.  For laptop and workstation installations, the default system configuration
    is usually be adequate.  To test the default configuration::

        cd coseis/
        python setup.py

    Systems with batch schedulers (such as PBS or LoadLeveler) generally require
    custom configuration to specify system resources, compiler options, and
    scheduler scripts.  If Coseis has already been configured for your system you
    can use one of the included configurations.  For example, for the TeraGrid
    Ranger system at TACC::

        python setup.py --machine=tacc-ranger

    To see the list of included configurations look in the ``cst/conf/`` directory.
    Each custom configuration is located in a separate sub-directory.  To create a
    new custom configuration, make a new sub-directory following the example of
    the supplied configurations.

6.  Compile component codes:
    ::

        python setup.py build

7.  Configure the Python path:
    ::

        python setup.py path

8.  Steps 5 through 7 can be combined as:
    ::

        python setup.py --machine=tacc-ranger build path

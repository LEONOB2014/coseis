SCEC-CVM FIXES

For PG Fortran, any optimization will break it.
For SUN Fortran, optimization greater than -O2 breaks it.

Do not rely on the compiler to initialize variables to zero.

Any open statements with the syntax type='old', change to standard syntax
status='old'.

Remove unused labels (stops warning messages): 1188 877 1182

Change character declarations to character(n) form (stops warnings)

Change argument of subroutine readbore from 'kerr' to 'k2err'

beginning:
       k2err = 0

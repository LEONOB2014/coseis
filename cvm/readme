TeraShake grid generation

First, unpack the SCEC VM ver. 4 in this directory. Then edit the "setup"
script for desired grid resolution and compiler flags. Running the setup
script will generate the mesh, convert TeraShake UTM coordinates to
lon/lat, and sample the SCEC VM. To run the MPI version make appropriate
changes to the script.




Notes on bug fixes made to the SCEC VM

Any open statements with the syntax type='old', change to standard
syntax status='old'.

Add the following line to subroutine makevel2:

         rd2rad=3.141593/180.

Do not rely on the compiler to initialize variables to zero. Add these
lines to the begining:

         inct = 0
         incto = 0
         do i = 1,isurmx
           iiiold(i) = 0
           inorold(i) = 0
           rsuqold(i) = 0.
         end do

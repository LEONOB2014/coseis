Notes on bug fixes made to the SCEC VM

Any open statements with the syntax type='old', change to standard
syntax status='old'.

Add the following line to subroutine makevel2:

       rd2rad=3.141593/180.

Do not rely on the compiler to initialize variables to zero.
Add to the begining of the main program:

       inct = 0
       incto = 0
       do i = 1,isurmx
         iiiold(i) = 0
         inorold(i) = 0
         rsuqold(i) = 0.
       end do

Add inside the first do loop of subroutine addtops:

       rtvels(n)=0.
       rtewts(n)=0.

Add to the beginning of subroutine makereg:

       alp = 0.
       bet = 0.

Add inside of do loops in subroutine readup

       rlaup(i) = 0.
       rloup(i) = 0.

## Summary

Coseis is an open-source toolkit for earthquake simulation featuring:

- The Support Operator Rupture Dynamics (SORD) code for modeling spontaneous
  rupture and 3D wave propagation.

- SCEC Community Velocity Models (CVM) codes, with MPI parallelization for
  [Magistrale version](http://www.data.scec.org/3Dvelocity/) (CVM-S), and new
  [geotechnical layer implementation](http://elygeo.net/2016-Vs30GTL-Ely+4/) for
  the [Harvard version](http://structure.harvard.edu/cvm-h/) (CVM-H).

- Utilities for mesh generation, coordinate projection, and visualization.

The primary interface is through a Python module which (for high-performance
components) wraps Fortran parallelized with hybrid OpenMP and MPI.

Coseis is written by [Geoffrey Ely] with contributions from Steven Day,
Bernard Minster, Feng Wang, Zheqiang Shi, and Jun Zhou.  It is licensed under
[BSD] terms.

## Install

1.  Mac OS X only: Install [Xcode] from the App Store followed by the Xcode the
    Command Line Tools with::

        xcode-select --install

2.  Mac OS X only: Install [Homebrew] and use it to install [Fortran] with::

        brew install gfortran

3.  Clone the source code from the [Coseis GitHub repository]
    (http://github.com/gely/coseis):

        git clone git://github.com/gely/coseis.git

4.  Setup python to be able to find the `cst` package:

        cd Coseis
        python -m cst setup

## Testing

To run the test suite interactively::

    cd Tests
    python test_runner.py --run=exec

Or, submit a job for batch processing::

    python test_runner.py --run=submit

After completion, a report is printed to the screen (or saved in
`run/test_suite/test_suite.output`)::

    PASSED: cst.tests.hello_mpi.test()
    PASSED: cst.tests.point_source.test()
    PASSED: cst.tests.pml_boundary.test()
    PASSED: cst.tests.kostrov.test()

## Examples

### CVM depth plane

![](../Figures/CVM-Slice-Vs-H.png)

Extract S-wave velocity at 500 meters depth. Plot using Matplotlib:

[CVM-Slice.py](../scripts/CVM-Slice.py)

### CVM-S fence diagram

![](../Figures/CVM-Fence-Vp-S.png)

Build a fence diagram similar to Magistrale (2000) figure 10. Plot using
Mayavi

[CVM-Fence.py](../scripts/CVM-Fence.py)

### CVM-S basin depth

![](../Figures/CVM-Basins.png)

Extract 3D mesh and search for the shallowest surface of Vs = 2.5 km/s. Plot
over topography using Mayavi.
